# PLC-OA-EmailNotifications
 
This script is compatible with the xlsx files that can be downloaded from Oxford abstracts. It expects two separate files for the author emails and the submission results, see the test_authors and test_results files for the formatting. 

Note also that double factor authentification must be turned on for the gmail account from which the notification emails are being sent.
